## Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project

Step 1: Let's Build a Command Interpreter to Manage My AirBnB Objects!

 As an aspiring developers, I am about to take my first big step towards building a full-fledged web application. This initial phase is incredibly important because the components I develop here will be the foundation for all future projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

Throughout this project, I  will achieve the following objectives, which are interconnected and essential to my success:

1. Implementing a parent class, named `BaseModel`, that will handle the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of my future object instances.
2. Establishing a simple flow for serialization/deserialization, allowing smooth transitions between Instance, Dictionary, JSON string, and file representations.
3. Designing all the necessary classes for my AirBnB project, such as User, State, City, Place, which will inherit from the `BaseModel` class.
4. Developing the initial storage engine for my project, known as File storage, which will serve as an abstracted interface.
5. Creating comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality and integrity of all my classes and the storage engine.

Now, let's talk about the Command Interpreter. Think of it as your trusty tool to effectively manage the objects within my project. With the Command Interpreter, I  can perform the following actions:

1. Creating new objects, such as a User or a Place, to enrich my AirBnB experience.
2. Retrieving objects from various sources, like files or databases, enabling seamless data access.
3. Executing operations on objects, allowing us to count, compute statistics, and more.
4. Updating attributes of objects to reflect changes accurately.
5. Deleting objects that are no longer needed, maintaining a tidy and organized project.
